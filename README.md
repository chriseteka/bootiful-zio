# Bootiful ZIO

This repo holds a pet project that explains some concepts in ZIO and gives you reasons to want to try ZIO.

Check out the article attached [`Article`](Article.md). Note that this was written with ZIO's version 2, but it will work
with version one, however you need to add an extra dependency `zio-magic`
